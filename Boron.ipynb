    "The eigenfunction solution to the Schrodinger equation for a multielectron system depends on the coordinates of all electrons. The orbital approximation says that we can represent a many-electron eigenfunction in terms of individual electron orbitals, each of which depends only on the coordinates of a sinlge electron. A _basis set_ in this context is a set of _basis functions_ used to approximate these orbitals. There are two general categories of basis sets: _minimal basis sets_ that describe only occupied orbitals and _extended basis sets_ that describe both occupied and unoccupied orbitals."

    "To make an even better approximation of our trial function, we may need to take into account polarization effects. (This accounts for the unequal distribution of electrons when two atoms approach each other.) We can include polarization effects by adding STOs of higher orbital angular momentum, _i.e.,_ d-type functions are added to describe valence electrons in 2p orbitals. The presence of poalrization functions is denoted by an asterisk. Two asterisks indicate polarization functions are added to hydrogens. (This would be important if you wanted to account for hydrogen bonding.) An asterisk in parentheses, ``(*)`` indicates that polarization functions are added only to second-row elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of diffuse functions is symbolized by the addition of a plus sign to the basis set designator: 6-31+G. Diffuse functions are also useful for systems in an excited stat, for systems with low ionization potential, and systems with some significant negative charge attached. A second +, such as 6-31++G, implies diffuse functions added to hydrogens. The use of double-diffuse basis set is especially useful if you are working with hydrides (H$^-$ ions)."

In essence, it is a _mean field_ approach that neglects individual electron-electron interactions or _electron correlation_.
